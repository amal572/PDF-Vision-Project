# computer-vision-project
We were asked to make a project to read files with the suffix pdf in a safe and comfortable way
Where we insert a pdf file into the program which basically provides the following:
- Reading in the eye comfort mode, which is completely similar to the situation in most smart devices
- Convert the background of the pages to a color of the user's choice
- Convert the writing to a color of the user's choice
- put a marker on the page of the book to continue reading from it
- The ability to move between pages (scaling) depending on the movement of the iris of the eye
- The ability to take a screenshot through the eyes

<h2>In This app:</h2>
- USE PyCharm Community Edition 
- or you can use jupyter
