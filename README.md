# Computer Vision Project

In this project, we were tasked with creating a program to read files with the suffix PDF safely and comfortably. The program provides the following features:

- Reading in eye comfort mode, similar to most smart devices.
- Ability to convert the background of the pages to a color of the user's choice.
- Ability to convert the writing to a color of the user's choice.
- Ability to place a marker on the page of the book to continue reading from it.
- Ability to move between pages (scaling) depending on the movement of the iris of the eye.
- Ability to take a screenshot through the eyes.

## Usage

- Use PyCharm Community Edition or you can use Jupyter.
  
## Used Libraries

- OpenCV: To install it, write `pip install opencv-python` in the command line.
- NumPy
- Python version 3.6
